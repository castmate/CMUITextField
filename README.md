# CMUITextField 2018

A simple UITextField subclass that mimics the Google Material text field somewhat

The idea of this is to subclass a normal UITextField but add a grey underline to it, which turns into a blue underline while the text field has focus and is presumably being edited.

Inspired by the Google Material Design single line text field. (http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html#)
